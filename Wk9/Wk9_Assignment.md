## Week 9: Filter BAM file

The goal is to use the BAM file created from previous assignment via Makefile and extract statistical and other relevant information.

### Question 1: How many reads did not align with the reference genome?



### Question 2: How many primary, secondary, and supplementary alignments are in the BAM file?




### Question 3: How many properly-paired alignments on the reverse strand are formed by reads contained in the first pair?




### Question 4: Make a new BAM file that contains only the properly paired primary alignments with a mapping quality of over 10.




### Question 5: Compare the flagstats between orginal and filtered BAM file.
