Lecture 2:

1. sed # command is used to automate search, find and replace (edit) text in scripts or file. Essentially it's a text manipulation command.

2. sed 's/cat/hat/g' filename.txt
  # The parameter 's/foo/bar/g' is to find the word(s) `cat` in the filename.txt and replace every `cat` found with `hat`. `s` argument specifies to substitute `cat` to `hat` and `g` means global, meaning replace every word that is/are `cat` in the .txt not just the first one it found.  

3. `-lh` 
  # will give me "human-friendly" mode. The complete command will look like this:
  ls -lh

4. `-i`  will ask user for confirmation before deletion. The complete command will look like this:
rm -i filename
